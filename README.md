Hi! Fresh Agro is one of my first projects, developed on request from Vilors Studio. I was responsible for the frontend part, focusing on building a clean and modern interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project reflects my early experience in layout, styling, and adding interactivity to deliver a simple and user-friendly design.
